				<h2>My (A Fan's) Story</h2>
				In August of 2021, I discovered LOLUET in my YouTube recommended. Her cover of Sayonara Tender captured me instantly. I downloaded what few songs she had posted to listen to on my phone, and followed from a distance whenever a new song was released. I have been a fan of many Utaite in the past, but this one had a stark diference that came apparaent upon her release of a cover of Shadow Shadow.
				<br><br>
				By chance, I witnessed Shadow Shadow mere seconds after its release onto youtube. It was the middle of the night, and my foolish groggy self decided to wait until the morning to download it for everyday listening. When I awoke, the cover was gone! Mere hours since I lay my eyes upon it. Since that day, I have developed an unusual determination to collect all the songs I can. I will say that LOLUET has put up a good unintentional fight. I enjoy the music, but I will not deny that I may also enjoy the chase.

				<br><br>You may also know me as u/LOLUET, the sole moderator of r/LOLUET. I am simply a fan who saw an artist I liked without a community to discuss the art with. While the subreddit I have made has become just a place to repost cover announcements, I would like to make this website a source of information. LOLUET is an ellusive artist, who shrouds herself quite well. Rebrands or not, I would like anyone who likes her music present to be able to view her music past. This will bother some. I would like to refer them to a phrase which I find fitting for a page like this:
				<br>
				<h3>"What goes on the internet stays on the internet."</h3>
				That is to say however, that I will not be hosting any reuploaded covers without the written permission of LOLUET herself. She has made it clear to me in personal messages that that would not be to her liking. I will respect those wishes.
				<br><br>
				I hope you find my resources useful. Though I have many endeavors in my life, I doubt this hobby of mine, as that is all it is, will end abruptly. I will provide updates to this site as I happen upon more data, and maybe one day construct something a little more "interractive". I consider myself very lucky. I will not be letting this opportunity of an available web domain pertaining to my interests go to waste.
