				<h2>Who is LOLUET?</h2>
				<!--<a class="selected" href=""></a>-->
				LOLUET, name unknown, is a singer from Japan. Known as an Utaite, she started off recording herself singing covers of songs and sharing them on 
				<a class="selected" href="https://www.nicovideo.jp/">niconico</a>.
				 At this point in her career, she was known under a different name: Reciel. From 2018 onward, along with posting on niconico, Reciel also released covers onto sites like 
				<a class="selected" href="https://www.youtube.com/">youtube</a>, 
				<a class="selected" href="https://soundcloud.com/">soundcloud</a>,
				 and even 
				<a class="selected" href="https://www.twitter.com">twitter</a>. 

				<br><br>After a few years of this, a name change occurred. On the 18th day of May, 2021, LOLUET was born. A new Youtube account, two new Twitter accounts, a new niconico account, and more came into existence. Since then, LOLUET has been releasing covers sporadically, with the occasional collaboration with large artists such as

				<a class="selected" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvq3kUGY5Dbsdkr3DZx25Sw">Giga</a>, and more. 

There have been breaks and nuances in her history between then and now, but that can all be examined carefully to your hearts content in the
